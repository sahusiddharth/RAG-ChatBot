"The Indorama Ventures Center for Clean Energy at Plaksha University dedicates its research endeavors to two critical domains. The first area of focus is Building Energy Efficiency, which acknowledges the rapid growth of India's construction sector and the emergence of smart cities. The center explores innovative solutions that enhance energy efficiency in buildings through urban planning, optimized building designs, energy-efficient equipment, and the integration of renewable energy sources. The second research area is Urban Heat Island (UHI), a phenomenon linked to rising temperatures in urban areas due to human activities. The center's UHI research encompasses visualizing UHI impacts, conducting microclimate studies, and implementing mitigation strategies such as cool roofs, passive design, vertical gardening, and reflective materials. These concerted efforts aim to significantly contribute to advancing clean energy and promoting sustainable urban development.","The Indorama Ventures Center for Clean Energy is at the forefront of research in two critical areas:

Building Energy Efficiency: As India's construction sector expands and the nation pursues the development of 100 smart cities by 2023, a pressing need arises for building energy efficiency solutions. Currently, the building sector accounts for a significant 32.6% of India's total electricity consumption, a figure set to increase. The center conducts multifaceted research on building efficiency, encompassing topics such as neighborhood planning, building envelope optimization, energy-efficient equipment, human behavior's impact on energy consumption, smart automation, renewable energy integration, energy storage solutions, and an analysis of policies and regulations. The aim is to advance sustainable and decarbonized building practices to ensure a cleaner, more energy-efficient future.

Urban Heat Island (UHI): UHIs result from human activities, causing urban areas to experience higher temperatures than their rural surroundings. This shift can lead to multiple challenges, including increased human mortality, compromised health and comfort, elevated energy consumption, and emissions. The center's research in this area includes visualizing the impact of UHIs through district-level simulations and microclimate studies. These investigations provide insights into the effects of human activities on urban temperatures and allow for the identification of problems and the formulation of solutions. Mitigation strategies involve implementing cool roofs, passive design modifications, urban planning, vertical gardening, and optimizing building materials to minimize the impact of UHIs, thereby enhancing urban livability and reducing energy consumption."
